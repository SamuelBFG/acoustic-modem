# An FSK and OFDM acoustic modem in MATLAB

This repository contains source code necessary to reproduce an acoustic modem in FSK and OFDM, presented 
at UNICAMP's IE533 course - Introduction to Digital Communications, lectured by Dr. Fraidenraich.

The main idea is to build a communication system using the air as the ISI noisy channel, on both FSK and OFDM 
communication modulations.
